    "   - Lower RMSE values for near-term predictions\n",
    "   - Higher RMSE values for mid-range predictions (MTLp5-MTLp8)\n",
    "   - RMSE increases with prediction horizon, suggesting growing uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "1. Use XGBoost as the primary model for this supply chain prediction task\n",
    "2. Consider ensemble methods for MTLp5-MTLp8 to improve performance\n",
    "3. Implement feature engineering or selection to enhance predictions for weaker targets\n",
    "4. Consider collecting additional relevant features for MTLp5-MTLp8 predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Improvements:\n",
    "1. Hyperparameter tuning for each model\n",
    "2. Feature importance analysis to understand key drivers\n",
    "3. Develop specialized models for the challenging prediction windows\n",
    "4. Implement stacking or blending of models for improved performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The models demonstrate strong predictive capability overall, with particular strength in near-term and long-term predictions, while showing room for improvement in mid-term forecasting."
